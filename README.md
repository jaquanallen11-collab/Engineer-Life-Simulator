## System Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel with Metal support
- Xcode 15.0 or later

## Building the Project

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select your target device
3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Architecture

### Metal 4 Pipeline
```swift
- MetalRenderer.swift: Main rendering engine
- Metal4MLPipeline.swift: ML inference pipeline  
- Shaders.metal: Particle rendering
- AdvancedShaders.metal: Post-processing effects
```

### SwiftUI Views
```swift
- ModernViews.swift: Start, Exam, University views
- ModernGameViews.swift: Main game, scenarios, predictions
- ModernShopViews.swift: Shop and portfolio interfaces
```

### Game Logic
```swift
- GameModels.swift: Data structures
- MLPredictor.swift: CoreML integration
- GameStore: State management
```

## CoreML Integration

The game uses CoreML models optimized for Metal 4:

```python
# Training script (Python)
import coremltools as ct

model = ct.convert(
    custom_model,
    inputs=[...],
    outputs=[...],
    convert_to='mlprogram',
    minimum_deployment_target=ct.target.macOS14,
)

model.save('CareerPredictor.mlpackage')
```

## Metal 4 Features Used

- ✅ ML Command Encoders
- ✅ Placement Heaps for intermediates
- ✅ Residency Sets for memory management
- ✅ Command Buffer Allocators
- ✅ Argument Tables for ML pipelines
- ✅ Performance Counters
